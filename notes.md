to deploy a Singular Contract while testing on anvil or a testnet:

to deploy a smart contract to a chain, use the following command of:

forge create <filename> --rpc-url http://<endpoint-url> --private-key <privatekey>.

you can get the endpoint url from metamask or from chainlist.org

example:
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80.

in the exmaple above, we are deploying to anvil's blockchain with a fake private key from anvil. if you want to run anvil, just run the command "anvil" in your terminal.

**_ HOWEVER WHEN DEPLOYING TO A REAL BLOCKCHAIN, YOU NEVER WANT TO HAVE YOUR PRIVATE KEY IN PLAIN TEXT _**

**_ ALWAYS USE A FAKE PRIVATE KEY FROM ANVIL OR A BURNER ACCOUNT FOR TESTING _**

**_ NEVER USE A .ENV FOR PRODUCTION BUILDS, ONLY USE A .ENV FOR TESTING _**

---

If you have a script, you can run a simulation of deploying to a blockchain with the command in your terminal of `forge script script/<file-name> --rpc-url http://<endpoint-url>`

example:
`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545`

this will create a broadcast folder, and all deployments will be in your deployment folder in case you want to view any information about your deployment.

to deploy to a testnet or anvil run the command of `forge script script/<file-name> --rpc-url http://<endpoint-url> --broadcast --private-key <private-key>`

example:
`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`

BroadCast Folder notes:

the `dry-run` folder is where the transactions with no blockchain specified go.

`run-latest.json` is the latest transaction sent. the transaction data will look like:

# I am adding comments to explain what is going on here:

```javascript
  "transactions": [
    {

      "hash": "0x8677435aa38539f85122ff0f9f6a30f0bb1587d6f08837b13b0dea2a8b8d217d", // the serial number of the transaction is called the hash
      "transactionType": "CREATE", // we are creating/deploying the contract onto the blockchain
      "contractName": "SimpleStorage", // name of contract
      "contractAddress": "0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3", // address the contract is deployed on
      "function": null,
      "arguments": null,
      "transaction": { // this transaction section is what is actually being sent on chain.
        "from": "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266", // the address i sent this transaction from
        "gas": "0x71556", // we can decode this by running the command `cast --to-base 0x71556 dec`. "dec" stands for decimal. it represents the type of format we want to decode the data to.
        "value": "0x0", // you can add value when deploying a contract by making the constructor payable in the contract being deployed and adding `SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage{value: 1 ether}();` in the deploy script.
        "input": "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5061057f8061...", // this is the contract deployment code and the contract being deployed code. This holds all the opcodes/EVM bytecode
        "nonce": "0x0", // In Solidity and Ethereum, a nonce is a number that keeps track of the number of transactions sent from an address. This increments everytime we send a transaction.
        "chainId": "0x7a69"
      },
      "additionalContracts": [],
      "isFixedGasLimit": false
    }
  ],
```

When you send a transaction, you are signing it and sending it.

# cast is a very helpful tool. run `cast --help` to see all the helpful things it can do.

Watch the video about this @ https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/what-is-a-transaction . if that does not work, then it is the foundry fundamentals course, section 1, lesson 18: "What is a transaction"

Nonce Main purpose:

Prevent transaction replay attacks (same transaction being executed multiple times)
Ensure transactions are processed in the correct order
Track the number of transactions sent by an account

**_ NEVER USE A .ENV FOR PRODUCTION BUILDS, ONLY USE A .ENV FOR TESTING _**

when using a .env, after adding the variables into the .env, run `source .env` in your terminal to added the environment variables.

then run `echo $<variable>` to check it it was added properly. example: `echo $PRIVATE_KEY` or `echo $RPC_URL`.

this way, when testing, instead of typing our rpc-url and private key into the terminal each time, we can instead run `forge script script/<file-Name> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`

example:
`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`

## DEPLOYING PRODUCTION CONTRACTS

**_ DEPLOYING PRODUCTION CONTRACTS _**
to deploy production contracts, you must encrypt your private key. this will result in you also creating a password for your private key, so don't lose it. to encrypt a private key run the following commands in your terminal, NOT in VS-Code or Cursor:

```javascript
`cast wallet import <your-account-name> --interactive` // pass an account name to name this wallet and do not forget the account name!
Enter private key: // it will prompt you to enter your private key to encrypt it
Enter password: // it will prompt you to enter a password. Don't forget the password!
`your-account-name` keystore was saved successfully. Address: address-corresponding-to-private-key
```

Then deploy with:
`forge script <script> --rpc-url <rpc_url> --account <account_name> --sender <address> --broadcast`

After you deploy with this command, it will prompt you for your password. Do not lose your account name, public address, password, and obviously, do not lose your private key!.

you can of course add a RPC_URL to your .env and run `forge script <script> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --account <account_name> --sender <address> --broadcast` as well. NEVER PUT YOUR PRIVATE KEY IN YOUR .env !!

you can run `cast wallet list` and it will show you all a list of the names you choose for the wallets you have encrpted.

after encrypting your private key clear your terminal's history with `history -c`

## How to interact with deployed contracts from the command line:

After you deploy a contract, you can interact with it:

if you type `cast --help` you will see a bunch of commands. One of the commands we are going to work with is going to be `send`. To see the arguments that `send` takes, run `cast send --help`; the arguments are:
`TO`: The destination of the transaction. If not provided, you must use cast send --create.
`SIG`: The signature of the function to call.
`ARGS`: The arguments of the function to call.

For example, if we want to call our store function in SimpleStorage.sol, we would run the following:
`cast send 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3 "store(uint256)" 123 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --account <accountName>`.

Explantion:
`cast send`: command to interact with the contract.
`0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`: address of the contract. if you forget what the address is, it can be found in the broadcast folder (check notes above).
`"store(uint256)"`: we want to interact with the store function, and it takes a uint256 as its parameter.
`123`: the values(arguments) that we want to pass.

Running this command will return a bunch of data, to read the data, run `cast call --help`. This will show you the arguments that `call` takes. The arguments are `TO`, `SIG`, and `ARGS` again! The difference is, `call` is calling a transaction to read data, whereas `send` is sending a transaction to modify the blockchain!

To use `call` run: `cast call <contract address> <function name> <input parameters>`

example:
`cast call 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3 "retrieve()" ` (the retrieve function has no input parameters so we leave it blank.)

this command will return hex data, and needs to be decoded. so to decode it, run `cast --to-base <hex-data> dec`

example: the hex data returned is: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b` so the command is `cast --to-base 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b dec` ("dec" stands for decimal. it represents the type of format we want to decode the data to.)

This returns the data that we submitted of `123`. (NOTE: This returns the data we submitted because it is the only data submitted and the contract function "retrieve" is written to return the most recent number.)
